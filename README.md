# Odin Recipes Project

This project is a basic recipe website created as part of The Odin Project's foundations course. The goal was to build a website that contains links to a few different recipes. It's a simple site, but it's built using the core HTML skills I've learned so far.

## Skills Demonstrated

Once completed, this project will have demonstrated the following skills:

* **Basic HTML Structure:** Setting up the standard HTML boilerplate.
* **Using HTML Elements:** Working with headings (`h1`, `h2`), paragraphs (`p`), images (`img`), and links (`a`).
* **Creating Lists:** Using ordered (`ol`) and unordered (`ul`) lists to display recipe ingredients and steps.
* **File and Directory Management:** Structuring the project files and linking between different pages.
* **Git & GitHub:** Using Git for version control and pushing the project to a GitHub repository.

## Self-Reflection

This was my first proper project, and it was a fantastic way to put theory into practice. I found setting up the initial HTML structure quite straightforward, but remembering to add `alt` text to all my images was something I had to consciously work on. Linking between the different recipe pages really helped me understand how websites are connected. Overall, it was a great confidence booster!
